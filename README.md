# Wellness Tracking System
Staying fit and healthy is something on everyone’s mind. One can think of a Wellness tracking system as a one stop shop to all fitness and wellness needs! The system has 
three different types of users. To start off with we have the professionals/trainers, who upload content that can range from physically intensive workout plans targeting athletes 
to home workouts for busy professionals as well as dietitians who can provide personal meal plans. Also, wellness is not limited to the body but also the mind, a wide range of 
meditation, breathing exercise sessions, etc can also be included. Next are the clients/customers, they register and get access to personalized content/plans that target their 
specific goals. Some of the awesome features can include, timetables/calendars, daily progress tracking, interactive sessions with the professionals etc. If the clients are not 
interested in a workout strategy, they can also use the system to input their daily activities/meals to retrospect how healthy their lifestyles are. Finally, the guys behind the 
scenes, the administrative users who screen and approve the trainer contents, manage the clients, handle customer queries and so forth.
